* proxy-ns
[[https://github.com/OkamiW/proxy-ns][proxy-ns]] is a lightweight(about 100 lines of code) tool to redirect
any programs' traffic to your local socks5 server.

Unlike =proxychains= (which uses =LD_PRELOAD= hack), it sets up a
vpn(using =tun2socks=) within a specific linux network namespace, and
execute the target program there.

** Features
It has several advantages over =proxychains=:
- UDP support
- Works for statically linked programs

** Installation
*** Arch Linux
proxy-ns is available at [[https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/proxy-ns][AUR]]

** Configuration
You may need to change =SOCKS5_PORT=
#+begin_src conf
SOCKS5_PORT=1080

DNS=9.9.9.9

# Set TCP_ONLY to 1 to force DNS over TCP
TCP_ONLY=1
#+end_src
